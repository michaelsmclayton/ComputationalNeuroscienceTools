// Create neural soma and dendrites

/* NEURON works with cylindrical sections. Here, we will create a neuron consisting of three sections:
a soma, and two dendrites. This can be done using the code below: */
ndend = 2
create soma, dend[ndend] // note here that multiple sections can be creating in a single line, using commas

// ---------------------------------------------
// Define soma properties
// ---------------------------------------------
/* After creating these neural sections, we need to set their properties and add their channels. We do this
below for the cell soma using curly brackets (setting the number of segments, the diameter and length of the
soma as well as insert Hodgkin-Huxley channels): */
soma {
    nseg = 1
    diam = 18.8
    L = 18.8
    Ra = 123.0
    insert hh
}

// ---------------------------------------------
// Note on the importance of the number of section compartments for accurate modelling
// ---------------------------------------------
/* We also want to add properties to our dendrites. To increase the spatial resolution of the dendrite, we can
increase the number of segments in the section (i.e. dendrite). In cable theory terms, this has the effect of
increasing the spatial resolution of the cable equation, and is important for accurate simulations. Note,
however, if the number of segments is too large, the simulation will be computationally inefficient. Therefore,
it is important to analyse the effects of spatial resolution on the results (in addition to other analyses),
in order to achieve both efficient and accurate simulation results).

NEURON distingusihes between sections (high level conceptual modelling construct) and segments (low level numerical
simulation detail) to allow one to create models that do not rely on the number of segments (or compartments). Rather,
you can create a model entirely independent of the numerical details. Then, if during the analysis you find you need
to increase the spatial resolution in a certain part of the model, you can do so simply by increasing nseg for that
section */

// ---------------------------------------------
// Define dendrite properties
// ---------------------------------------------
/* For our simulation, we are interested in seeing the potentials travel along the dendrites, so we want to increase the
number of segments. Therefore, we define our dendrites to both have five segments. We can do this using followng for loop: */
for i = 0, ndend-1 dend[i] {
    nseg = 5
    Ra = 123
    insert pas
}

/* However, we may want our dendrites to have some properties that differ from one another. We can do this using dot
notation (as shown below): */
dend[0].diam = 3.18
dend[0].L = 701.9
dend[1].diam = 2.0
dend[1].L = 549.1

//                                          CONNECTING THE SECTIONS
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* Now that we have all of the sections created and their properties set, we need to connect them together. In NEURON, to
refer to specific points along a section, we use the section name followed by a number between 0 and 1 in parenthesis.
This number represents the distance along the section. For example, dend[0](0) refers to a point at the proximal end of
dendrite 0 (i.e. located next to the soma), dend[0](1) refers to a point at the distal end of that dendrite, and dend[0](0.2)
refers to a point 20% down the dendrite (i.e. away from the soma). We use this notation to specify exactly what point of one
section connects to what point on another section, as well as where to place point processes (e.g. electrical stimulation)
in a given section.

// ---------------------------------------------
// A note on the effects of nsegs on defining section locations
// ---------------------------------------------
/* You will notice that the use of percentages means that the aforementioned method of specifying a point on the section is
conceptually independent of the number of segments in the section. In other words, 'dend(.1)' should, in theory, always refer
to a position 10% down the dendrite. However, it is important to remember that the number of section segments can significantly
affect the location of a section that is refered to. For example, if a section has only 1 segment, and a location of .1 is
specified, this may in practice refer to a position of 0.5. (The logic here is that there is only 1 segment to refer to, so it
can only refer to that one segment). However, increasing the number of segements to, say, 3, does not automatially fix this issue.
With nsegs increased to 3, a synapse placed at .1 may still, in practice, be positioned at .5 (due to the issue explained above).
Consequently, it is always best to specify the number of section segments before attaching synapses or point processes. However,
if this is not possibe, it is possible to re-position the point processes by using their loc() function. For example, if we had
a clamp called stim, we could move stim to 0.1 with the hoc statement 'stim.loc(0.1)' and this would move the point process as
close to 10% down to attached section as possible. */

// ---------------------------------------------
// Connecting sections
// ---------------------------------------------
/* For our simulation, we are going to connect the soma and the dendrites together. We use the 'connect' command to accomplish
this (passing the sections we want to connect, divided by a comma). Note here that the first dendrite is connected to one side
of the soma (i.e. 'soma(0'), while the second dendrite is connected to the other side of the soma (i.e. 'soma(1'): */
connect dend[0](0), soma(0)
connect dend[1](0), soma(1)
