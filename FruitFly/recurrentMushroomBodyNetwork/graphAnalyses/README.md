    <b>Shortest path connections between appetitive and aversive DANs</b>. This figure shows the shortest paths between DANs conveying appetitive (blue) and aversive (red) information. For connections from appetitive to aversive DANs (top panel), links occur principally through feed-across neurons (FANs), which project sraight to aversive DANs. In contrast, connections from aversive to appetitive DANs (bottom panel) travel through feedback neurons (FBNs), which then project straight to appetitve DANs in the medial lobe. Note that this graph shows only the shortest paths between these neurons, and does not describe all possible routes. Connections from appetitive DAN-h1 were excluded as no post-synaptic partners for this neuron were found.
